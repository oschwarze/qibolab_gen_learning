Qibolab is the dedicated `Qibo <https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo>`_ backend for
quantum hardware control. This module automates the implementation of quantum
circuits on quantum hardware. Qibolab includes:

1. :ref:`Platform API <main_doc_platform>`: support custom allocation of quantum hardware platforms / lab setup.
2. :ref:`Drivers <main_doc_instruments>`: supports commercial and open-source firmware for hardware control.
3. :ref:`Arbitrary pulse API <main_doc_pulses>`: provide a library of custom pulses for execution through instruments.
4. :ref:`Compiler <main_doc_compiler>`: compiles quantum circuits into pulse sequences.
5. :ref:`Quantum Circuit Deployment <tutorials_circuits>`: seamlessly deploys quantum circuit models on quantum hardware.
